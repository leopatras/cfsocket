Demonstrates the problem described in
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71769404/would-like-to-find-and-connect-to-devices-on-your-local-network-error-with-inb

Run the applicaton on a IOS >= 15.3 device and connect with the browser
to \<youriphone-ip\>:9100 or run

`echo hallo | nc <youriphone-ip> 9100`

You get the annoying popup with a CFSocket inbound connection.
